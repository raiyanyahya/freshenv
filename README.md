## The Story

This is a solution to a problem I have always had. I like my system to be clean, minimal and structured. 
It gets quite tricky to manage multiple projects on my on machine, projects tend to gather and are placed everywhere. 
Overtime managing system wide dependencies becomes a problem. It is quite easy to mess up a system setting or to 
keep track of a package I wont need tomorrow. This is why I built ```freshenv```. It is a command line application
 which helps developers in running and managing completely isolated developer environments locally. 
It fetches and lets you run environment flavours in the form of docker containers
which are preconfigured with tools and packages developer needs everyday. Read about the usage below. 
I imagine it would help developers like me. I hope you like it.

## Flavours

```freshenv flavours``` are different configurations for freshenv environments. You choose a flavour and provision it as an environment. A flavour can be a combination of operating systems, language packs, tools and application bundles. By default freshenv provisions you with a ```base``` flavour which runs ubuntu 18.04 and has packages like ```wget git python3-pip curl zsh wget nano zsh``` and more. The base flavour is a 260mb environment when provisioned. There are bigger flavours like ```devenv``` which runs on the latest ubuntu and has been loaded and configured with ```docker (run docker inside your freshenv environment), golang, python, node, java, a vscode server, build-essential automake make cmake sudo g++ wget git python3-pip curl zsh wget nano nodejs npm fonts-powerline``` and more. This environment is around 1.6gb large. Freshenv also gives you the option to provision a language based environment which contains necessary developer tools for that language. Checkout the usage section below on the flavours command to see a list of flavours available.

## Custom Environments

Freshenv lets developers build and provision custom environments. A custom flavour is a configuration of the base operating system, packages to install and the command to run when your environment is provisioned. Custom flavours are configured in a config file placed under $HOME/.freshenv/freshenv. This file will be automatically created once you run ```freshenv build config```. Below is an example of a custom flavour.

```yml
[MyEnv]
base="ubuntu"
install="apt update -y && apt upgrade -y && apt install arandr"
cmd="bash"
```

This feature is part of the 1.1.0 release and is not available in older versions.

## Installation Linux

I recommend using the snap package manager to install freshenv. 

```console
  snap install freshenv 
  
  # give it access to the docker interface
  snap connect freshenv:docker docker:docker-daemon 
```

If you dont have or use snap, install the freshenv python package from pypi. 

```console
  pip install freshenv
```

I would recommend using pipx instead of pip to install cli applications on you machine.

## Installation MacOS

I am trying to get freshenv on homebrew-core but I need more stars on the repository for 
them to accept my pull request. The self hosted tap is available
on the repo raiyanyahya/homebrew-freshenv. Install the freshenv python package from a self hosted homebrew tap.

```console
  brew tap raiyanyahya/freshenv
  brew install freshenv
```

# Freshenv 
```freshenv``` is a  command line application to provision and manage local developer environments. Build and develop your projects in completely isolated environments. Save, switch and restart your environments. 

## The Story

This is a solution to a problem I have always had. I like my system to be clean, minimal and structured. 
It gets quite tricky to manage multiple projects on my on machine, projects tend to gather and are placed everywhere. 
Overtime managing system wide dependencies becomes a problem. It is quite easy to mess up a system setting or to 
keep track of a package I wont need tomorrow. This is why I built ```freshenv```. It is a command line application
 which helps developers in running and managing completely isolated developer environments locally. 
It fetches and lets you run environment flavours in the form of docker containers
which are preconfigured with tools and packages developer needs everyday. Read about the usage below. 
I imagine it would help developers like me. I hope you like it.


## Installation Linux

Install the freshenv python package from pypi. You must have ```docker``` and ```python3.6+```  installed.

```console
  pip install freshenv
```

I would recoomend using pipx instead of pip to install cli applications on you machine.

## Installation MacOS

Install the freshenv python package from a self hosted homebrew tap. You must have ```docker``` and ```python3.6+```  installed.

```console
  brew tap raiyanyahya/freshenv
  brew install freshenv
```

I am trying to get freshenv on homebrew-core but I need more stars on the repository for 
them to accept my pull request. The self hosted tap is available
on the repo raiyanyahya/homebrew-freshenv.
